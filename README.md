# launchy-mods

Some mods we include in launchy are only hosted on CurseForge which provides no easy way to download them with the tool.

To avoid the security risk of hosting them ourselves, if the mod has an open source license, we publish those mods as releases on GitHub. We will make an effort to set up automated workflows on the original repository to create releases we can use, however it is up to the original authors to review and accept those contributions.
